Observable Trends in School Performance Data: 

1) Charter schools overall tended to have higher rates of students passing reading and/or math scores with lower per capita spend. However, this per capita spend was distributed among a small overall size of students, which could suggest that despite having lower per capita spend, class sizes were likely smaller in charter schools, which can contribute signifigantly to the potential success of students. 

2) While the "type summary" data would imply a wide 20 point range variation of success between charters and district schools, the actual gulf between the percentage of students has more to do with the higher percentage of charter schools with students who have passing math scores. This may also be skewing the overall passing statistic as well.
